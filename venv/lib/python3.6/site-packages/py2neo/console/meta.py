If command line arguments are provided, these are executed in order as
statements. If no arguments are provided, an interactive console is
presented.

Statements entered at the interactive prompt or as arguments can be
regular Cypher, transaction control keywords or slash commands. Multiple
Cypher statements can be entered on the same line separated by semicolons.
These will be executed within a single transaction.

For a handy Cypher reference, see:

  https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/current/

Transactions can be managed interactively. To do this, use the transaction
control keywords BEGIN, COMMIT and ROLLBACK.

Slash commands provide access to supplementary functionality.
