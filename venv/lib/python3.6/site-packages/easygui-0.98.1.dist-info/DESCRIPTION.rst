ABOUT EASYGUI
=============

EasyGui provides an easy-to-use interface for simple GUI interaction
with a user.  It does not require the programmer to know anything about
tkinter, frames, widgets, callbacks or lambda.  All GUI interactions are
invoked by simple function calls that return results.

Example Usage
-------------

    >>> import easygui
    >>> easygui.ynbox('Shall I continue?', 'Title', ('Yes', 'No'))
    1
    >>> easygui.msgbox('This is a basic message box.', 'Title Goes Here')
    'OK'
    >>> easygui.buttonbox('Click on your favorite flavor.', 'Favorite Flavor', ('Chocolate', 'Vanilla', 'Strawberry'))
    'Chocolate'
